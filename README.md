# Hi there 👋, my name is Anna Kochetkova anikush-yes in Git

I am a problem solver who applies this skill in the testing field. Complex challenges are not obstacles but a pleasure to overcome. I have received a tester certification, but it's just the beginning—a good start - the finish line is unattainable...
